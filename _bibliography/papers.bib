abstract = {This study empirically investigates whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic affects corporate financial asset holdings. We find that firms with higher pandemic exposure are less likely to hold financial assets. Mechanism analyses suggest that the return-chasing rationale dominates the precautionary motive concerning the pandemic effect on corporate financial asset holdings. Furthermore, firms prefer to liquidate highly liquid financial assets to fill the pandemic-induced liquidity shortage. This study contributes to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic regarding corporate portfolio choice, and sheds light on corporate resilience to crises.}

abstract = {This paper empirically explores the effect of monetary policy uncertainty on corporate cash holdings in China. We find robust evidence that monetary policy uncertainty is positively related to corporate cash holdings. The firms’ precautionary behavior in cash holdings is chiefly attributed to the increase in financial frictions rather than the reduction in corporate investments. The promoting effect of monetary policy uncertainty on cash holdings is more pronounced among firms with more severe financial constraints, firms with higher dependence on external finance, firms with worse access to bank financing, and non-SOEs, and during the period of monetary policy tightening. Our study suggests that firms hold more cash to cushion potential liquidity shortfalls induced by the increase in monetary policy uncertainty.}

  abstract={Effective regulation can help improve the quality of information disclosure, and the deterrent effect of regulation has always been one of the important concerns for academics and practitioners. This paper empirically analyzes the deterrent effect of the “double random” spot checks of listed firms by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on the earnings management behavior of listed firms using manually-collected data of such “double random” spot checks from 2016 to 2020. We use the expected probability of spot checks as the perceived regulation intensity. This paper finds that first, the “double random” spot check mechanism has a significant deterrent effect on the accrual earnings management of listed companies. The higher the perceived regulation intensity, the weaker the earnings management behavior. Second, this deterrent effect is affected by the market- oriented and law-based environment in the region, the nature of ownership and .corporate governance. Third, corporate audit fees are negatively related to perceived regulation intensity, while auditors will require higher audit fees for firms selected for spot checks. The paper provides empirical evidence for evaluating the effect and impact of the “double random” spot check mechanism of listed firms by the CSRC.},

  keywords={Dialect Diversity, Economic Policy Uncertainty, Corporate Investment Efficiency, Corporate Agility},
  abstract={This research empirically examines how dialect diversity influences corporate investment efficiency under different levels of economic policy uncertainty. Our findings reveal that local dialect diversity enhances investment efficiency during stable periods, but this advantage significantly diminishes under high economic policy uncertainty. This reduction primarily arises from underinvestment and overly cautious decision-making by fragmented management during periods of turmoil. Further analysis indicates that this decline is exacerbated by stronger internal governance, which emphasizes checks and balances, and mitigated by stronger external governance, which focuses on supervisory power. Our findings remain robust when adopting alternative measures of key variables and utilizing topography as an instrumental variable.}

  year={2025},
  keywords={ESG, Government procurement, Government-enterprise collusion},
  abstract={This paper investigates the role of government-enterprise collusion in shaping firms’ ESG performance. Based on the sample of China’s A-share listed firms from 2015 to 2022, we find that same-city government procurements significantly improve firms’ ESG performance, while government procurements awarded by non-local governments show no significant effect on ESG outcomes. We propose and empirically validate an explanation that local governments strategically use government procurement projects to incentivize firms’ ESG actions. The positive effect of local government procurements on corporate ESG performance is more pronounced in the cities with lower fiscal pressure or a long-tenured mayor. Additional analyses demonstrate that these effects are particularly pronounced among privately-owned enterprises rather than state-owned enterprises, with environmental and governance dimensions showing the strongest responses. This study suggests that government-enterprise collusion represents a profound yet previously underexplored motivation for firms’ ESG activities, particularly in emerging economies where governments play a pivotal role in shaping institutional and economic frameworks.}

  note={Scheduled to be presented at The 22nd Chinese Finance Annual Meeting (CFAM) 2025, Nanjing, China},
  keywords={Monetary Policy Uncertainty, Trade Credit, Financial Constraints, Bargaining Power},
  abstract={This paper examines how monetary policy uncertainty affects corporate trade credit decisions using Chinese listed non-financial firms from 2007Q1 to 2021Q4. Employing an unpredictability-based monetary policy uncertainty index, we find that monetary policy uncertainty significantly increases accounts payable from suppliers, decreases accounts receivable to customers, and reduces net trade credit position. Mechanism analysis shows that monetary policy uncertainty significantly increases firms' financing costs. Firms facing more severe financing constraints are more motivated to adjust their trade credit strategies. Firms with stronger bargaining power are better positioned to secure favorable trade credit arrangements. The effects are stronger for non-state- owned enterprises and concentrated during monetary policy tightening periods. These findings provide novel micro-level evidence on how monetary policy uncertainty transmits through trade credit networks.}

  abstract={This study examines how digital transformation influences the market value of corporate cash holdings using data from Chinese non-financial listed firms from 2007 to 2023. Our findings reveal that digital transformation significantly enhances cash value. Mechanism analysis shows that this effect operates primarily through expanding investment opportunities—evidenced by increased R&D intensity and patent applications—rather than through mitigating agency problems or alleviating financing constraints. Heterogeneity analyses demonstrate that the positive effect is more pronounced among firms with lower financial constraints, better corporate governance, and those in non-high-tech industries. Our results highlight that digital transformation creates value by enhancing firms' innovation capabilities and expanding productive uses of cash.}
