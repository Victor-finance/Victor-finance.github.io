I am an Assistant Professor at College of Business Administration, Capital University of Economics and Business, where I conduct research on corporate finance, corporate governance, sustainable finance, and institutional economics. I also work as a research assoiate at Institute of International M&As and Investment, Renmin University of China.

I received my Ph.D. in Financial Engineering and M.A. in Finance from Renmin University of China, and B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Finance from Central University of Finance and Economics.
